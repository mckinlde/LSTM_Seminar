Okay so LSTM is what I'm doing inside an RNN cell

Meaning say my RNN is trained on a categorical (one-hot?) make, one-hot model, year, odometer, zip

I use LSTM once the RNN is already built

Predict price of a car at this ODO based on same car at this ODO

Predict price of a car at this ODO-Year based on same car at this ODO-Year weighted average

A ford explorer's age is a weighted average of year and mileage

Time series: ford explorer's average price as it ages

LSTM Data Prep:
    1. Transform the time series into a supervised learning problem.

    2. Transform the sime series data so that it is stationary.

    3. Transform the observations to have a specific scale.
